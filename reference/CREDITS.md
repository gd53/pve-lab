# Credits

## In Memory

- **[tteck](https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox)** — Creator of the original Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts. His work simplified Proxmox for thousands of homelabbers. tteck coordinated the migration of his project to the community before his passing. His scripts live on through the [community-scripts](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE) fork, maintained by volunteers in his memory.

## Inspiration

- [community-scripts/ProxmoxVE](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE) — Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts (Community Edition). The one-script-per-task approach that inspired this repo.
- [Techno Dad Life](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnoDadLife) — YouTube channel that inspired this homelab journey. Practical Proxmox and self-hosting tutorials.
- [DB Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@DBTechYT) — YouTube channel consistently covering new Docker containers and self-hosting tools. A go-to source for discovering what to run.
